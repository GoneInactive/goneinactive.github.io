            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Ryan Watts, a Statistics and Data Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder whose fascination with quantitative finance began with simple moving average strategies for Bitcoin during my sophomore year of high school. What started as casual experimentation on Robinhood quickly evolved into a multi-year deep dive into market microstructure, spreads, high-frequency trading, and the mathematical foundations of modern markets, transforming me into an active market maker in illiquid cryptocurrency exchanges. Today, I develop sophisticated trading frameworks like TradeByte (built with Python and Rust), implement complex statistical models for options pricing and correlation strategies, and serve as President of CU Quants, where we apply advanced mathematical concepts like Markov processes and stochastic calculus to real-world trading scenarios. Beyond finance, I'm drawn to intellectual challenges that mirror quantitative thinking: poker strategy, mathematical puzzles, and optimization problems, all while enjoying Colorado's slopes and trails when I'm not running Monte Carlo simulations or coding trading algorithms. Capital markets captivate me because they represent the ultimate real-time feedback loop where statistical models meet market reality, and success is measured in tangible results that validate or challenge your quantitative hypotheses.

                My path into quantitative finance wasn't linear, but rather an organic evolution driven by curiosity and mathematical intuition. That initial fascination with Bitcoin's price movements led me down increasingly complex paths: understanding bid-ask spreads, diving into market microstructure theory, and eventually grasping the intricate dance of high-frequency trading algorithms. Each layer revealed new mathematical challenges and opportunities for systematic profit generation.
                
                The transition from retail trading to institutional-level thinking happened gradually through CU Quants, where I found myself naturally gravitating toward leadership roles due to my combination of technical skills and trading experience. As President, I've guided our team through projects that bridge academic theory with practical implementation: developing rigorous backtesting frameworks, implementing sophisticated risk management systems, and applying advanced mathematical concepts like stochastic calculus to options pricing models. Our work isn't just theoretical; we're building systems that could realistically compete in professional trading environments.

                What drives me beyond the markets is the same analytical mindset that makes quantitative finance compelling. Poker taught me about expected value calculations and psychological game theory. Mathematical puzzles sharpen the pattern recognition skills essential for identifying market inefficiencies. Even my recreational activities in Colorado's mountains require the same risk assessment and strategic thinking that inform my trading decisions. This intersection of intellectual rigor and real-world application is what makes quantitative finance endlessly fascinating: every statistical model, every algorithm, every hypothesis gets tested against the unforgiving reality of market performance, providing immediate and honest feedback on the quality of your quantitative reasoning.
